        "abstract": "User behavior analysis is crucial in human-centered AI applications. In this field, the collection of sufficient and high-quality user behavior data has always been a fundamental yet challenging problem. An intuitive idea to address this problem is automatically simulating the user behaviors. However, due to the subjective and complex nature of human cognitive processes, reliably simulating the user behavior is difficult. Recently, large language models (LLM) have obtained remarkable successes, showing great potential to achieve human-like intelligence. We argue that these models present significant opportunities for reliable user simulation, and have the potential to revolutionize traditional study paradigms in user behavior analysis. In this paper, we take recommender system as an example to explore the potential of using LLM for user simulation. Specifically, we regard each user as an LLM-based autonomous agent, and let different agents freely communicate, behave and evolve in a virtual simulator called RecAgent. For comprehensively simulation, we not only consider the behaviors within the recommender system (\\emph{e.g.}, item browsing and clicking), but also accounts for external influential factors, such as, friend chatting and social advertisement. Our simulator contains at most 1000 agents, and each agent is composed of a profiling module, a memory module and an action module, enabling it to behave consistently, reasonably and reliably. In addition, to more flexibly operate our simulator, we also design two global functions including real-human playing and system intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our simulator, we conduct extensive experiments from both agent and system perspectives. In order to advance this direction, we have released our project at {https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Rec}."

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been an emergence of employing LLM-powered agents as believable human proxies, based on their remarkable decision-making capability. However, existing studies mainly focus on simulating human dialogue. Human non-verbal behaviors, such as item clicking in recommender systems, although implicitly exhibiting user preferences and could enhance the modeling of users, have not been deeply explored. The main reasons lie in the gap between language modeling and behavior modeling, as well as the incomprehension of LLMs about user-item relations. To address this issue, we propose AgentCF for simulating user-item interactions in recommender systems through agent-based collaborative filtering. We creatively consider not only users but also items as agents, and develop a collaborative learning approach that optimizes both kinds of agents together. Specifically, at each time step, we first prompt the user and item agents to interact autonomously. Then, based on the disparities between the agents&#39; decisions and real-world interaction records, user and item agents are prompted to reflect on and adjust the misleading simulations collaboratively, thereby modeling their two-sided relations. The optimized agents can also propagate their preferences to other agents in subsequent interactions, implicitly capturing the collaborative filtering idea. Overall, the optimized agents exhibit diverse interaction behaviors within our framework, including user-item, user-user, item-item, and collective interactions. The results show that these agents can demonstrate personalized behaviors akin to those of real-world individuals, sparking the development of next-generation user behavior simulation."
