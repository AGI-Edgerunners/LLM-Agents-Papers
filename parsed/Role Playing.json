        "abstract": " Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications\nranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal\ncommunication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative\nagents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.\nGenerative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,\nwhile authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\nconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next\nday. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a\nlarge language model to store a complete record of the agent&#39;s experiences\nusing natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level\nreflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate\ngenerative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by\nThe Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents\nusing natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce\nbelievable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with\nonly a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine&#39;s\nDay party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the\nnext two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the\nparty, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We\ndemonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent\narchitecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically\nto the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with\ncomputational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and\ninteraction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.\n"

In this paper, we present Chameleon, an AI system that mitigates\nthese limitations by augmenting LLMs with plug-and-play modules for\ncompositional reasoning. Chameleon synthesizes programs by composing various\ntools (e.g., LLMs, off-the-shelf vision models, web search engines, Python\nfunctions, and heuristic-based modules) for accomplishing complex reasoning\ntasks. At the heart of Chameleon is an LLM-based planner that assembles a\nsequence of tools to execute to generate the final response. We showcase the\neffectiveness of Chameleon on two multi-modal knowledge-intensive reasoning\ntasks: ScienceQA and TabMWP. Chameleon, powered by GPT-4, achieves an 86.54%\noverall accuracy on ScienceQA, improving the best published few-shot result by\n11.37%. On TabMWP, GPT-4-powered Chameleon improves the accuracy by 17.0%,\nlifting the state of the art to 98.78%.

To surmount these challenges, we\nintroduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT),\nwhich generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting\nlanguage models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts)\nthat serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving.

Along this direction, one representative\nstrategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the\nfeedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such\nreflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem:\nonce the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to\ngenerate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is\nincorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD)\nframework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of\n&#34;tit for tat&#34; and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final\nsolution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs\nwhich would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation.\nExperiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation\nand counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate\nand the modest level of &#34;tit for tat&#34; state are required for MAD to obtain good\nperformance.

How can we model this inferential ability? In this paper,\nwe introduce a model of a cooperative team where one agent, the principal, may\ncommunicate natural language instructions about their shared plan to another\nagent, the assistant, using GPT-3 as a likelihood function for instruction\nutterances. We then show how a third person observer can infer the team&#39;s goal\nvia multi-modal Bayesian inverse planning from actions and instructions,\ncomputing the posterior distribution over goals under the assumption that\nagents will act and communicate rationally to achieve them. We evaluate this\napproach by comparing it with human goal inferences in a multi-agent gridworld,\nfinding that our model&#39;s inferences closely correlate with human judgments (R =\n0.96). When compared to inference from actions alone, we also find that\ninstructions lead to more rapid and less uncertain goal inference, highlighting\nthe importance of verbal communication for cooperative agents.\n"

Powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 were trained on a large corpus of TV show data which lets us believe that with the right guidance users will be able to rewrite entire seasons. \"That Is What Entertainment Will Look Like. Maybe people are still upset about the last season of Game of Thrones. Imagine if you could ask your A.I. to make a new ending that goes a different way and maybe even put yourself in there as a main character or something."

        "abstract": " With recent advancements in natural language processing, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various real-world\napplications. Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs\nmay prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a\ncombination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we\nfirst propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and\ndiscuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems.\nWithin this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step\nagent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we\ninstantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning\nand Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings\nand challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and\npractitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study\nemphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying\nareas that need more investigation and improvement.\n"

        "abstract": " Text evaluation has historically posed significant challenges, often\ndemanding substantial labor and time cost. With the emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs), researchers have explored LLMs&#39; potential as alternatives for\nhuman evaluation. While these single-agent-based approaches show promise,\nexperimental results suggest that further advancements are needed to bridge the\ngap between their current effectiveness and human-level evaluation quality.\nRecognizing that best practices of human evaluation processes often involve\nmultiple human annotators collaborating in the evaluation, we resort to a\nmulti-agent debate framework, moving beyond single-agent prompting strategies.\nThe multi-agent-based approach enables a group of LLMs to synergize with an\narray of intelligent counterparts, harnessing their distinct capabilities and\nexpertise to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in handling intricate tasks.\nIn this paper, we construct a multi-agent referee team called ChatEval to\nautonomously discuss and evaluate the quality of generated responses from\ndifferent models on open-ended questions and traditional natural language\ngeneration (NLG) tasks. Our analysis shows that ChatEval transcends mere\ntextual scoring, offering a human-mimicking evaluation process for reliable\nassessments.
