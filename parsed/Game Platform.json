        "abstract": " CB2 is a multi-agent platform to study collaborative natural language\ninteraction in a grounded task-oriented scenario. It includes a 3D game\nenvironment, a backend server designed to serve trained models to human agents,\nand various tools and processes to enable scalable studies. We deploy CB2 at\nhttps://cb2.ai as a system demonstration with a learned instruction following\nmodel.\n"
