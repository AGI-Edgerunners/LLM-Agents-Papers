        "abstract": " Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through\nthe use of multi-agents driven by large language models (LLMs). However,\nexisting works primarily focuses on simple tasks lacking exploration and\ninvestigation in complicated tasks mainly due to the hallucination problem.\nThis kind of hallucination gets amplified infinitely as multiple intelligent\nagents interact with each other, resulting in failures when tackling\ncomplicated problems.Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative framework\nthat infuses effective human workflows as a meta programming approach into\nLLM-driven multi-agent collaboration. In particular, MetaGPT first encodes\nStandardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts, fostering structured\ncoordination. And then, it further mandates modular outputs, bestowing agents\nwith domain expertise paralleling human professionals to validate outputs and\nreduce compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages the assembly line work\nmodel to assign diverse roles to various agents, thus establishing a framework\nthat can effectively and cohesively deconstruct complex multi-agent\ncollaborative problems. Our experiments conducted on collaborative software\nengineering tasks illustrate MetaGPT&#39;s capability in producing comprehensive\nsolutions with higher coherence relative to existing conversational and\nchat-based multi-agent systems. This underscores the potential of incorporating\nhuman domain knowledge into multi-agents, thus opening up novel avenues for\ngrappling with intricate real-world challenges.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising\nperformance as general task-solving agents, they still struggle with tasks that\nrequire intensive domain knowledge and complex reasoning. In this work, we\npropose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a single LLM into a\ncognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with multiple\npersonas. A cognitive synergist refers to an intelligent agent that\ncollaborates with multiple minds, combining their individual strengths and\nknowledge, to enhance problem-solving and overall performance in complex tasks.\nBy dynamically identifying and simulating different personas based on task\ninputs, SPP unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. We have\ndiscovered that assigning multiple, fine-grained personas in LLMs elicits\nbetter problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of\npersonas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing,\nCodenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing both\nknowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, such\nas Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs, SPP\neffectively elicits internal knowledge acquisition abilities, reduces\nhallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities.

To bridge this gap, we introduce collaborative generative agents, endowing LLM-based Agents with consistent behavior patterns and task-solving abilities. We situate these agents in a simulated job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize their coordination skills. We propose a novel framework that equips collaborative generative agents with human-like reasoning abilities and specialized skills.

        "abstract": "In open multi-agent environments, the agents may encounter unexpected teammates. Classical multi-agent learning approaches train agents that can only coordinate with seen teammates. Recent studies attempted to generate diverse teammates to enhance the generalizable coordination ability, but were restricted by pre-defined teammates. In this work, our aim is to train agents with strong coordination ability by generating teammates that fully cover the teammate policy space, so that agents can coordinate with any teammates. Since the teammate policy space is too huge to be enumerated, we find only dissimilar teammates that are incompatible with controllable agents, which highly reduces the number of teammates that need to be trained with. However, it is hard to determine the number of such incompatible teammates beforehand. We therefore introduce a continual multi-agent learning process, in which the agent learns to coordinate with different teammates until no more incompatible teammates can be found. The above idea is implemented in the proposed Macop (Multi-agent compatible policy learning) algorithm. We conduct experiments in 8 scenarios from 4 environments that have distinct coordination patterns. Experiments show that Macop generates training teammates with much lower compatibility than previous methods. As a result, in all scenarios Macop achieves the best overall coordination ability while never significantly worse than the baselines, showing strong generalization ability."
