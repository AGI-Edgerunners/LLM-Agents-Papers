Recent\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential for\nhuman-like agents. To help these agents adapt to new tasks without extensive\nhuman supervision, we propose the Learning through Communication (LTC)\nparadigm, a novel training approach enabling LLM agents to improve continuously\nthrough interactions with their environments and other agents. Through\niterative exploration and PPO training, LTC empowers the agent to assimilate\nshort-term experiences into long-term memory. To optimize agent interactions\nfor task-specific learning, we introduce three structured communication\npatterns: Monologue, Dialogue, and Analogue-tailored for common tasks such as\ndecision-making, knowledge-intensive reasoning, and numerical reasoning. We\nevaluated LTC on three datasets: ALFWorld (decision-making), HotpotQA\n(knowledge-intensive reasoning), and GSM8k (numerical reasoning). On ALFWorld,\nit exceeds the instruction tuning baseline by 12% in success rate. On HotpotQA,\nLTC surpasses the instruction-tuned LLaMA-7B agent by 5.1% in EM score, and it\noutperforms the instruction-tuned 9x larger PaLM-62B agent by 0.6%. On GSM8k,\nLTC outperforms the CoT-Tuning baseline by 3.6% in accuracy. The results\nshowcase the versatility and efficiency of the LTC approach across diverse\ndomains. We will open-source our code to promote further development of the\ncommunity.\n"

These agent tasks employ LLMs as the\ncentral controller responsible for planning, memorization, and tool\nutilization, necessitating both fine-grained prompting methods and robust LLMs\nto achieve satisfactory performance. Though many prompting methods have been\nproposed to complete particular agent tasks, there is lack of research focusing\non improving the agent capabilities of LLMs themselves without compromising\ntheir general abilities. In this work, we present AgentTuning, a simple and\ngeneral method to enhance the agent abilities of LLMs while maintaining their\ngeneral LLM capabilities. We construct AgentInstruct, a lightweight\ninstruction-tuning dataset containing high-quality interaction trajectories. We\nemploy a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy by combining AgentInstruct with\nopen-source instructions from general domains. AgentTuning is used to\ninstruction-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in AgentLM. Our evaluations show\nthat AgentTuning enables LLMs&#39; agent capabilities without compromising general\nabilities. The AgentLM-70B is comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo on unseen agent\ntasks, demonstrating generalized agent capabilities. We open source the\nAgentInstruct and AgentLM-7B, 13B, and 70B models at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/AgentTuning, serving open and powerful alternatives to\ncommercial LLMs for agent tasks.\n"

        "abstract": "Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoored behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoored behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via &#34;self-talk&#34; of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data."

RAISE, an enhancement of the ReAct framework, incorporates a dual-component memory system, mirroring human short-term and long-term memory, to maintain context and continuity in conversations. It entails a comprehensive agent construction scenario, including phases like Conversation Selection, Scene Extraction, CoT Completion, and Scene Augmentation, leading to the LLMs Training phase. This approach appears to enhance agent controllability and adaptability in complex, multi-turn dialogues. Our preliminary evaluations in a real estate sales context suggest that RAISE has some advantages over traditional agents, indicating its potential for broader applications.

        "abstract": "Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex tasks. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. We even notice that AutoAct, when using the Llama-2-13b model, can achieve performance comparable to that of the zero-shot GPT-3.5-Turbo agent. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct."
