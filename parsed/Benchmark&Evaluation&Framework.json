        "abstract": " The rise of large language models (LLMs) had a transformative impact on\nsearch, ushering in a new era of search engines that are capable of generating\nsearch results in natural language text, imbued with citations for supporting\nsources. Building generative information-seeking models demands openly\naccessible datasets, which currently remain lacking. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new dataset, HAGRID (Human-in-the-loop Attributable Generative\nRetrieval for Information-seeking Dataset) for building end-to-end generative\ninformation-seeking models that are capable of retrieving candidate quotes and\ngenerating attributed explanations. Unlike recent efforts that focus on human\nevaluation of black-box proprietary search engines, we built our dataset atop\nthe English subset of MIRACL, a publicly available information retrieval\ndataset. HAGRID is constructed based on human and LLM collaboration. We first\nautomatically collect attributed explanations that follow an in-context\ncitation style using an LLM, i.e. GPT-3.5. Next, we ask human annotators to\nevaluate the LLM explanations based on two criteria: informativeness and\nattributability. HAGRID serves as a catalyst for the development of\ninformation-seeking models with better attribution capabilities.\n"

Since the investigation of LAA\nis still very recent, limited explorations are available.

Additionally, we propose a new strategy to orchestrate multiple LAAs\nsuch that each labor LAA focuses on one type of action, \\textit{i.e.} BOLAA,\nwhere a controller manages the communication among multiple agents. We conduct\nsimulations on both decision-making and multi-step reasoning environments,\nwhich comprehensively justify the capacity of LAAs. Our performance results\nprovide quantitative suggestions for designing LAA architectures and the\noptimal choice of LLMs, as well as the compatibility of both.

Existing datasets for web agents either use\nsimulated websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not\nsuitable for generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected\nfrom 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the\ntasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist\nweb agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world\nwebsites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of\nuser interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we conduct an initial exploration\nof using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While\nthe raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we\nshow that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the\neffectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level\nof performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen\nbefore, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly\ngeneralizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and\ntrained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitate further\nresearch on building a generalist agent for the web.\n"

        "abstract": "Can Large Language Models (LLMs) simulate human behavior in complex environments? LLMs have recently been shown to exhibit advanced reasoning skills but much of NLP evaluation still relies on static benchmarks. Answering this requires evaluation environments that probe strategic reasoning in competitive, dynamic scenarios that involve long-term planning. We introduce AucArena, a novel simulation environment for evaluating LLMs within auctions, a setting chosen for being highly unpredictable and involving many skills related to resource and risk management, while also being easy to evaluate. We conduct several controlled simulations using state-of-the-art LLMs as bidding agents. We find that through simple prompting, LLMs do indeed demonstrate many of the skills needed for effectively engaging in auctions (e.g., managing budget, adhering to long-term goals and priorities), skills that we find can be sharpened by explicitly encouraging models to be adaptive and observe strategies in past auctions. These results are significant as they show the potential of using LLM agents to model intricate social dynamics, especially in competitive settings. However, we also observe considerable variability in the capabilities of individual LLMs. Notably, even our most advanced models (GPT-4) are occasionally surpassed by heuristic baselines and human agents, highlighting the potential for further improvements in the design of LLM agents and the important role that our simulation environment can play in further testing and refining agent architectures."

SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies.

        "abstract": " Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning abilities, but\ntranslating reasoning into actions in the real world remains challenging. In\nparticular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a\nminimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an\ninternal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework\nwith provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we\ncall &#34;reason for future, act for now&#34; (\\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design\na prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a\nfuture trajectory over a long horizon (&#34;reason for future&#34;). At each step, the\nLLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (&#34;act for now&#34;),\nstores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning\nroutine to replan the future trajectory from the new state. The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in\nBayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt\nLLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory\nbuffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps\nthat maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning\nsubroutines are performed in an &#34;in-context&#34; manner to emulate the actor-critic\nupdate for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of\nlong-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\\sqrt{T}$ regret. In\nparticular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the\nprior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction\nachieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it\noutperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a\nfew benchmarks.\n"
