Building generative information-seeking models demands openly\naccessible datasets, which currently remain lacking. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new dataset, HAGRID (Human-in-the-loop Attributable Generative\nRetrieval for Information-seeking Dataset) for building end-to-end generative\ninformation-seeking models that are capable of retrieving candidate quotes and\ngenerating attributed explanations. Unlike recent efforts that focus on human\nevaluation of black-box proprietary search engines, we built our dataset atop\nthe English subset of MIRACL, a publicly available information retrieval\ndataset. HAGRID is constructed based on human and LLM collaboration. We first\nautomatically collect attributed explanations that follow an in-context\ncitation style using an LLM, i.e. GPT-3.5. Next, we ask human annotators to\nevaluate the LLM explanations based on two criteria: informativeness and\nattributability. HAGRID serves as a catalyst for the development of\ninformation-seeking models with better attribution capabilities.\n"

With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected\nfrom 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the\ntasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist\nweb agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world\nwebsites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of\nuser interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we conduct an initial exploration\nof using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While\nthe raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we\nshow that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the\neffectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level\nof performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen\nbefore, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly\ngeneralizable agents.

LLMs have recently been shown to exhibit advanced reasoning skills but much of NLP evaluation still relies on static benchmarks. Answering this requires evaluation environments that probe strategic reasoning in competitive, dynamic scenarios that involve long-term planning. We introduce AucArena, a novel simulation environment for evaluating LLMs within auctions, a setting chosen for being highly unpredictable and involving many skills related to resource and risk management, while also being easy to evaluate. We conduct several controlled simulations using state-of-the-art LLMs as bidding agents. We find that through simple prompting, LLMs do indeed demonstrate many of the skills needed for effectively engaging in auctions (e.g., managing budget, adhering to long-term goals and priorities), skills that we find can be sharpened by explicitly encouraging models to be adaptive and observe strategies in past auctions. These results are significant as they show the potential of using LLM agents to model intricate social dynamics, especially in competitive settings. However, we also observe considerable variability in the capabilities of individual LLMs. Notably, even our most advanced models (GPT-4) are occasionally surpassed by heuristic baselines and human agents, highlighting the potential for further improvements in the design of LLM agents and the important role that our simulation environment can play in further testing and refining agent architectures."

Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies.

In\nparticular, it remains unclear how to complete a given task provably within a\nminimum number of interactions with the external environment, e.g., through an\ninternal mechanism of reasoning. To this end, we propose a principled framework\nwith provable regret guarantees to orchestrate reasoning and acting, which we\ncall &#34;reason for future, act for now&#34; (\\texttt{RAFA}). Specifically, we design\na prompt template for reasoning that learns from the memory buffer and plans a\nfuture trajectory over a long horizon (&#34;reason for future&#34;). At each step, the\nLLM agent takes the initial action of the planned trajectory (&#34;act for now&#34;),\nstores the collected feedback in the memory buffer, and reinvokes the reasoning\nroutine to replan the future trajectory from the new state. The key idea is to cast reasoning in LLMs as learning and planning in\nBayesian adaptive Markov decision processes (MDPs). Correspondingly, we prompt\nLLMs to form an updated posterior of the unknown environment from the memory\nbuffer (learning) and generate an optimal trajectory for multiple future steps\nthat maximizes a value function (planning). The learning and planning\nsubroutines are performed in an &#34;in-context&#34; manner to emulate the actor-critic\nupdate for MDPs. Our theoretical analysis proves that the novel combination of\nlong-term reasoning and short-term acting achieves a $\\sqrt{T}$ regret. In\nparticular, the regret bound highlights an intriguing interplay between the\nprior knowledge obtained through pretraining and the uncertainty reduction\nachieved by reasoning and acting. Our empirical validation shows that it\noutperforms various existing frameworks and achieves nearly perfect scores on a\nfew benchmarks.\n"

We propose a framework for conducting safe autonomous agent tests on the open internet: agent actions are audited by a context-sensitive monitor that enforces a stringent safety boundary to stop an unsafe test, with suspect behavior ranked and logged to be examined by humans. We a design a basic safety monitor that is flexible enough to monitor existing LLM agents, and, using an adversarial simulated agent, we measure its ability to identify and stop unsafe situations. Then we apply the safety monitor on a battery of real-world tests of AutoGPT, and we identify several limitations and challenges that will face the creation of safe in-the-wild tests as autonomous agents grow more capable."

However, a considerable divide exists between these benchmark achievements and their practical applicability, primarily attributed to real-world programming&#39;s reliance on pre-existing libraries. Instead of evaluating LLMs to code from scratch, this work aims to propose a new evaluation setup where LLMs use open-source libraries to finish machine learning tasks. Therefore, we propose ML-Bench, an expansive benchmark developed to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in leveraging existing functions in open-source libraries. Consisting of 10044 samples spanning 130 tasks over 14 notable machine learning GitHub repositories. In this setting, given a specific machine learning task instruction and the accompanying README in a codebase, an LLM is tasked to generate code to accomplish the task. This necessitates the comprehension of long and language-code interleaved documents, as well as the understanding of complex cross-file code structures, introducing new challenges. Notably, while GPT-4 exhibits remarkable improvement over other LLMs, it manages to accomplish only 39.73\\% of the tasks, leaving a huge space for improvement. We address these challenges by proposing ML-Agent, designed to effectively navigate the codebase, locate documentation, retrieve code, and generate executable code. Empirical results demonstrate that ML-Agent, built upon GPT-4, results in further improvements. Code, data, and models are available at \\url{https://ml-bench.github.io/}."

        "abstract": "Building AIs with adaptive behaviors in human-AI cooperation stands as a pivotal focus in AGI research. Current methods for developing cooperative agents predominantly rely on learning-based methods, where policy generalization heavily hinges on past interactions with specific teammates. These approaches constrain the agent&#39;s capacity to recalibrate its strategy when confronted with novel teammates. We propose \\textbf{ProAgent}, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to fashion a \\textit{pro}active \\textit{agent} empowered with the ability to anticipate teammates&#39; forthcoming decisions and formulate enhanced plans for itself. ProAgent excels at cooperative reasoning with the capacity to dynamically adapt its behavior to enhance collaborative efforts with teammates. Moreover, the ProAgent framework exhibits a high degree of modularity and interpretability, facilitating seamless integration to address a wide array of coordination scenarios. Experimental evaluations conducted within the framework of \\textit{Overcook-AI} unveil the remarkable performance superiority of ProAgent, outperforming five methods based on self-play and population-based training in cooperation with AI agents. Further, when cooperating with human proxy models, its performance exhibits an average improvement exceeding 10\\% compared to the current state-of-the-art, COLE. The advancement was consistently observed across diverse scenarios involving interactions with both AI agents of varying characteristics and human counterparts. These findings inspire future research for human-robot collaborations. For a hands-on demonstration, please visit \\url{https://pku-proagent.github.io}."
