        "abstract": " Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently\ndemonstrated their remarkable abilities of communicating with human users. In\nthis technical report, we take an initiative to investigate their capacities of\nplaying text games, in which a player has to understand the environment and\nrespond to situations by having dialogues with the game world. Our experiments\nshow that ChatGPT performs competitively compared to all the existing systems\nbut still exhibits a low level of intelligence. Precisely, ChatGPT can not\nconstruct the world model by playing the game or even reading the game manual;\nit may fail to leverage the world knowledge that it already has; it cannot\ninfer the goal of each step as the game progresses. Our results open up new\nresearch questions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, and natural language processing.\n"

This roadmap intends to draw interdisciplinary research\nteams to a comprehensive list of emergent ideas in HGAI, identifying their\ninterested topics while maintaining a coherent big picture of the future work\nlandscape.\n"
