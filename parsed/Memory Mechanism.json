        "abstract": " Memorization, or the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to output\nentire sequences from their training data verbatim, is a key concern for safely\ndeploying language models. In particular, it is vital to minimize a model&#39;s\nmemorization of sensitive datapoints such as those containing personal\nidentifiable information (PII). The prevalence of such undesirable memorization\ncan pose issues for model trainers, and may even require discarding an\notherwise functional model. We therefore seek to predict which sequences will\nbe memorized before a large model&#39;s full train-time by extrapolating the\nmemorization behavior of lower-compute trial runs. We measure memorization of\nthe Pythia model suite, and find that intermediate checkpoints are better\npredictors of a model&#39;s memorization behavior than smaller fully-trained\nmodels. We additionally provide further novel discoveries on the distribution\nof memorization scores across models and data.\n"

Despite this, a notable\nhindrance remains-the deficiency of a long-term memory mechanism within these\nmodels. This shortfall becomes increasingly evident in situations demanding\nsustained interaction, such as personal companion systems and psychological\ncounseling. Therefore, we propose MemoryBank, a novel memory mechanism tailored\nfor LLMs. MemoryBank enables the models to summon relevant memories,\ncontinually evolve through continuous memory updates, comprehend, and adapt to\na user personality by synthesizing information from past interactions. To mimic\nanthropomorphic behaviors and selectively preserve memory, MemoryBank\nincorporates a memory updating mechanism, inspired by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting\nCurve theory, which permits the AI to forget and reinforce memory based on time\nelapsed and the relative significance of the memory, thereby offering a\nhuman-like memory mechanism. MemoryBank is versatile in accommodating both\nclosed-source models like ChatGPT and open-source models like ChatGLM. We\nexemplify application of MemoryBank through the creation of an LLM-based\nchatbot named SiliconFriend in a long-term AI Companion scenario. Further tuned\nwith psychological dialogs, SiliconFriend displays heightened empathy in its\ninteractions.

To address this limitation, we propose the\nSelf-Controlled Memory (SCM) system to unleash infinite-length input capacity\nfor large-scale language models. Our SCM system is composed of three key\nmodules: the language model agent, the memory stream, and the memory\ncontroller. The language model agent iteratively processes ultra-long inputs\nand stores all historical information in the memory stream. The memory\ncontroller provides the agent with both long-term memory (archived memory) and\nshort-term memory (flash memory) to generate precise and coherent responses.\nThe controller determines which memories from archived memory should be\nactivated and how to incorporate them into the model input. Our SCM system can\nbe integrated with any LLMs to enable them to process ultra-long texts without\nany modification or fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our SCM system\nenables LLMs, which are not optimized for multi-turn dialogue, to achieve\nmulti-turn dialogue capabilities that are comparable to ChatGPT, and to\noutperform ChatGPT in scenarios involving ultra-long document summarization or\nlong-term conversations.

        "abstract": " Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) through their extensive parameters and comprehensive\ndata utilization. However, existing LLMs lack a dedicated memory unit, limiting\ntheir ability to explicitly store and retrieve knowledge for various tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose RET-LLM a novel framework that equips LLMs with a\ngeneral write-read memory unit, allowing them to extract, store, and recall\nknowledge from the text as needed for task performance. Inspired by Davidsonian\nsemantics theory, we extract and save knowledge in the form of triplets. The\nmemory unit is designed to be scalable, aggregatable, updatable, and\ninterpretable. Through qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority\nof our proposed framework over baseline approaches in question answering tasks.\nMoreover, our framework exhibits robust performance in handling temporal-based\nquestion answering tasks, showcasing its ability to effectively manage\ntime-dependent information.\n"

Due to their approximate\nnature and proneness to the accumulation of errors, conventional neural memory\nmechanisms cannot support LLMs to simulate complex reasoning. In this paper, we\nseek inspiration from modern computer architectures to augment LLMs with\nsymbolic memory for complex multi-hop reasoning. Such a symbolic memory\nframework is instantiated as an LLM and a set of SQL databases, where the LLM\ngenerates SQL instructions to manipulate the SQL databases.

        "abstract": " Language agents have shown some ability to interact with an external\nenvironment, e.g., a virtual world such as ScienceWorld, to perform complex\ntasks, e.g., growing a plant, without the startup costs of reinforcement\nlearning. However, despite their zero-shot capabilities, these agents to date\ndo not continually improve over time beyond performance refinement on a\nspecific task. Here we present CLIN, the first language-based agent to achieve\nthis, so that it continually improves over multiple trials, including when both\nthe environment and task are varied, and without requiring parameter updates.\nOur approach is to use a persistent, dynamic, textual memory centered on causal\nabstractions (rather than general &#34;helpful hints&#34;) that is regularly updated\nafter each trial so that the agent gradually learns useful knowledge for new\ntrials. In the ScienceWorld benchmark, CLIN is able to continually improve on\nrepeated trials on the same task and environment, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art reflective language agents like Reflexion by 23 absolute\npoints. CLIN can also transfer its learning to new environments (or new tasks),\nimproving its zero-shot performance by 4 points (13 for new tasks) and can\nfurther improve performance there through continual memory updates, enhancing\nperformance by an additional 17 points (7 for new tasks). This suggests a new\narchitecture for agents built on frozen models that can still continually and\nrapidly improve over time.\n"

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive linguistic capabilities. However, a key limitation persists in their lack of human-like memory faculties. LLMs exhibit constrained memory retention across sequential interactions, hindering complex reasoning. This paper explores the potential of applying cognitive psychology&#39;s working memory frameworks, to enhance LLM architecture. The limitations of traditional LLM memory designs are analyzed, including their isolation of distinct dialog episodes and lack of persistent memory links. To address this, an innovative model is proposed incorporating a centralized Working Memory Hub and Episodic Buffer access to retain memories across episodes. This architecture aims to provide greater continuity for nuanced contextual reasoning during intricate tasks and collaborative scenarios. While promising, further research is required into optimizing episodic memory encoding, storage, prioritization, retrieval, and security. Overall, this paper provides a strategic blueprint for developing LLM agents with more sophisticated, human-like memory capabilities, highlighting memory mechanisms as a vital frontier in artificial general intelligence."

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models, AI assistants like ChatGPT have widely entered people&#39;s works and lives. In this paper, we present an evolving large language model assistant that utilizes verbal long-term memory. It focuses on preserving the knowledge and experience from the history dialogue between the user and AI assistant, which can be applied to future dialogue for generating a better response. The model generates a set of records for each finished dialogue and stores them in the memory. In later usage, given a new user input, the model uses it to retrieve its related memory to improve the quality of the response. To find the best form of memory, we explore different ways of constructing the memory and propose a new memorizing mechanism called conditional memory to solve the problems in previous methods. We also investigate the retrieval and usage of memory in the generation process. The assistant uses GPT-4 as the backbone and we evaluate it on three constructed test datasets focusing on different abilities required by an AI assistant with long-term memory."
